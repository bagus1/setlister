#### Key Features:
- **Artist Auto-fill**: Types to search existing artists, creates new ones automatically
- **Vocalist Auto-fill**: Same system as artists, but different vocalists don't create new songs
- **Duplicate Handling**: Same title + different artist = different songs; same title + different vocalist = edit existing
- **Time Field**: Duration tracking for set length calculations
- **Color Coding**: Clear visual distinction for title, vocalist, and key
- **Excluded Features**: No lyrics, chords, tabs, or videos support

### **Artist Management**
**Route**: `/artists` (list) and `/artists/x` (artist songs)
- **Artist Pages**: Show all songs by that artist
- **Create Links**: Direct links to `/songs/new` for adding songs

### **Medley System**
- **Definition**: Combination of multiple songs into one record
- **Naming**: Auto-concatenate first two words of songs + "medley"
- **Display**: Shows as single song in song lists
- **Creation**: Form to name medley and add multiple songs

### **Setlist Management**

#### **Setlist Creation** (`/bands/x/setlists/y/edit`)
- **Auto-creation**: New setlist button creates DB record and redirects to edit
- **Socket.io Powered**: Real-time collaboration between band members
- **Layout**: 
  - Left side: All band songs
  - Right side: 5 drop areas (4 sets + "maybe" list)
- **Actions**: Save button, "Finalize setlist" button

#### **Setlist Finalization** (`/bands/x/setlists/x/finalize`)
- **Socket.io Powered**: Real-time collaborative editing
- **Layout**: Songs displayed in rows of two sets each
- **Reordering**: Drag-drop between sets and within sets
- **Deletion Logic**: 
  - Delete from set â†’ moves to maybe list
  - Delete from maybe â†’ removes completely
- **Controls**: Save and cancel buttons
- **Calculations**: Set length and total time (excluding maybes)

#### **Print/Export** (`/bands/x/setlists/x/print`)
- **Default**: Song titles only
- **Optional Fields**: Artist, vocalist, length, key
- **Format**: One song per line text export
- **Customizable**: Controls to select which fields to include

#### **CSV Export** (`/setlists/x/export-csv`)
- **Format**: Comma-separated values file download
- **Fields**: Set, Order, Title, Artist, Vocalist, Key, Time, BPM
- **Usage**: Direct download for spreadsheet applications
- **Data**: Complete song information for each setlist song

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start Guide**

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/bagus1/setlister.git
cd setlister

# Install dependencies  
npm install

# Start server
npm start
# OR for development with auto-reload:
npm run dev
```

### **First Use Workflow**
1. **Visit** http://localhost:3000
2. **Register** new user account
3. **Create** first band 
4. **Add** songs to system (artists/vocalists auto-created)
5. **Manage** band's song selection at `/bands/1/songs`
6. **Create** new setlist for collaborative editing
7. **Drag songs** between sets in real-time
8. **Finalize** and export completed setlist

---

## ðŸŽ­ **Key Workflow Patterns**

### **Song Creation Flow**
1. User types in song form
2. Artist field auto-completes from existing artists
3. If new artist typed â†’ creates new Artist record
4. Vocalist field auto-completes from existing vocalists  
5. Same title + different artist = new Song
6. Same title + different vocalist = prompts to edit existing

### **Setlist Collaboration Flow**
1. Band member creates setlist â†’ auto-redirects to edit page
2. Share edit URL with other band members
3. All users see real-time updates via Socket.io
4. Drag-drop operations sync across all connected clients
5. Auto-save prevents data loss

### **Band Management Flow**
1. Create band â†’ becomes admin/creator
2. Invite members via email (SendGrid)
3. Manage which songs band plays at `/bands/x/songs`
4. Only band songs available in setlist editor
5. Collaborative setlist creation and finalization
