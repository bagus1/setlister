## Database Safety

The script includes proper cascading deletes to maintain database integrity:

- **Deleting a user** removes their band memberships and invitations
- **Deleting a band** removes all related setlists, memberships, and invitations
- **Deleting a song** removes all band associations
- **Cleanup** only removes expired invitations

## Environment

The script uses the same database configuration as your main application, so it will work with your local development database or production database depending on your environment variables.
