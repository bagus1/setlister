        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Purpose limitation</strong>: We will process Personal Data for specified and legitimate
                purposes, and will not process it in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes, unless permitted

                <strong>Data minimization</strong>: We will process Personal Data that is adequate, relevant and limited

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data accuracy</strong>: We take appropriate measures to ensure that the Personal Data that we
                hold about you is
                accurate, complete and, where necessary, kept up to date. However, it is also your responsibility to
                ensure that your Personal Data is kept as accurate, complete and current as possible by informing us
                promptly of any changes or errors. You should notify us of any changes to the Personal Data that we hold
                about you (e.g. new home address or change of name).
            </li>

                <strong>Data security</strong>: We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the
                Personal Data
                that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security
                appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data. Specific measures we use include to-date

        <p class="ug-news-text">
            <u>Information security</u>. To safeguard against unauthorized access to Personal Data by third parties, all
            electronic Personal Data held by Ultimate Guitar is maintained on systems that are protected by up-to-date
            secure network architectures that contain firewalls and intrusion detection devices. The data saved in
            servers is "backed up" (i.e. the data are recorded on separate media) to avoid the consequences of any
            inadvertent erasure, destruction or loss otherwise. The servers are stored in facilities with high security,
            access restricted to unauthorized personnel, fire detection and response systems.
        </p>
        <p class="ug-news-text">
            <u>Physical and administrative security</u>. We employ reasonable physical and administrative safeguards to
            protect
            your Personal Data. While we will use such efforts, we cannot and will not insure the security of your
            information. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission,
            unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable

            When you visit our Service, certain non-personally identifying information is recorded automatically by the
            standard operation of our Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its
            operating system, and your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that your Internet service
            provider assigns to your computer whenever you surf the Internet) is gathered in order to facilitate our
            online operations and to assure an efficient online experience for you. If you access our Service from a
            mobile or other device, we may collect information for that device (including operating system, browser,
            type of device) in order to facilitate our mobile operations and to assure an efficient mobile experience
            for you. We may use or share this information for security purposes, to generate group statistics about our

            If you access our Service from a social network like Facebook, Ultimate Guitar receives certain information

        </p>

        <p class="ug-news-text">
            Among the purposes for which we may use such generally non-personally identifying information is for
            identification purposes in the event of an emergency threatening life or property, or where proper legal
            process allows using such information. For instance, we may use your IP address or other automatically
            recorded information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt to identify you if it is
            necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you because you are violating the Terms of Service
            for use for this Service, may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with

                        been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it
                        from any further processing until deletion is possible.

            advertisers</h2>
        When you give Personal Data to Ultimate Guitar, we may ask you to allow us to share that data (together with
        non-personally identifying information you may provide) with our promotional partners and third-party
        advertisers. In such instances, our general practice is to ask you to "opt-in" to share such data and
        information on, for example, a specific promotion, registration page or contests. However, in some instances,
        and where law permits, we may ask you to "opt-out" from sharing such data and information with a given
        promotional partner or third party advertiser in connection with a specific promotion, registration page or
        contests. If you prefer, you may give us blanket permission to share your Personal Data with all of our
        promotional partners and third-party advertisers. Conversely, you may also choose not to allow us to share your
        Personal Data with any other companies outside Ultimate Guitar.
        </p>

        <p class="ug-news-text">
            If you consent to share your Personal Data with our promotional partners and third-party advertisers, you

            policies. You have the option to change your mind and to stop us from further sharing your Personal Data
            with our promotional partners and third-party advertisers by modifying your preferences or by contacting

            retrieve any Personal Data shared with our promotional partners and third-party advertisers prior to your

        All your personal data is stored on our servers in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, we use third party
        service providers and business partners who may be operating from outside the EEA and therefore, your data may

            We have put in place appropriate safeguards (which includes the European Commission's Standard Contractual
            Clauses) to ensure that whenever your Personal Data is transferred outside the EEA to countries that are not
            deemed adequate by the European Commission, your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in
            accordance with the GDPR.

        In some instances, we carry out profiling to better understand our users and their potential interests. However,
        profiling does not result in automated decisions being taken that legally affect you or similarly significantly
        affect you.

        The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") provides California residents, referred to in the law as
        "consumers," with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of personal
        information, as well as rights to access and control personal information. Certain information that we collect
        may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (because it is made available by a
        government entity) or covered by another federal privacy law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
        <br/>
        To the extent that we collect personal information about you that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our
        practices, and your rights are described below.


        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Right to information regarding the categories of personal information collected, sold, and

                we collect, sell, or disclose. That information is provided in this Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Right to be free from discrimination</b>. California law restricts any discrimination based on
                exercising your rights on personal information, for example, providing different quality of goods or
                services, offering different prices, or setting penalties.
